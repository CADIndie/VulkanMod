### Steps:

There are none! Simply download the mod from one of the download buttons above and then move the JAR file into your **mods** folder like any other mod.

## Known Issues

- Linux and macOS may not work. We are working on ways to improve those platforms.

- Most mods that affect rendering in any way are likely to not work with this mod. Read note one for more info.

- We don't recommend launchers that are **not** the Mojang Launcher as using a custom launcher may break this mod!

## Notes
- If you come across any mod that do not work with this mod, please create an issue inside **this** repo and **do not** report it to the mod developer.

- Sodium will **NEVER** be supported! This is because it directly changes elements of Minecraft that we do as well and in turn would be a waste of time to use.
